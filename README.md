## How it works

* The prefab contains a sub-animator, a sender, a receiver, and a renderer.  
* The sub-animator constantly animates the sender on, which is setting ``IsRendering`` to true.  
* When the renderer is not in view, the sub-animator stops running and will no longer animate the sender on.  
* The main-animator can then animate the sender off, which sets ``IsRendering`` to false.

## Install guide

* Merge the Animator Cdontroller ``IsRendering FX`` to your own FX Controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Drag & Drop the ``IsRendering Detection`` prefab onto the avatar.
* Expand the prefab hierarchy and find ``Culling Animator`` -> ``Renderer``.
* Modify the bounds of the renderer to fit the view target such as your avatar.

## How to use

The ``IsRendering`` parameter is a bool. The value will be true when ``Renderer`` is in view, and false when outside of view.  
Under the prefab's hierarchy, the ``IsRendering Container`` is enabled when in view. ``IsNotRendering Container`` is enabled when not in view.

The containers have a cube and sphere for previewing and confirming that it works. Feel free to delete them.  
The FX layer ``Is Rendering`` is for the preview. It uses a 10 frames delay for [coyote time](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coyote_time). Feel free to delete it.
