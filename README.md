## How it works

* The prefab contains a sub-animator, a sender, a receiver, and a renderer.  
* The sub-animator constantly animates the sender on, setting ``IsRendering`` to true.  
* When the renderer is not in view, the sub-animator stops running and will no longer animate the sender on.  
* The main-animator can then animate the sender off, setting ``IsRendering`` to false.

## Install guide

https://github.com/VRLabs/IsRendering-Detection/assets/76777936/b51ac145-17a8-47eb-acbf-883242073b6b

* Merge the Animator Controller ``IsRendering FX`` to your own FX Controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Drag & Drop the ``IsRendering Detection`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Expand the prefab hierarchy and find ``Culling Animator`` -> ``Renderer``.
* Modify the bounds of the renderer to fit the view target such as your avatar.

## How to use

* Add the ``RenderingDetection/IsRendering`` bool parameter to any of your Playable Layers. The value will be ``True`` when ``Renderer`` is in view, and false when outside of view.
  * You can use this bool to build your own systems in your FX Controller.
* In the prefab's hierarchy, the ``IsRendering Container`` is enabled when in view. ``IsNotRendering Container`` is enabled when not in view.
  * You can put your own objects into the containers to show or hide them accordingly
  * The containers include a cube and sphere for previewing and confirming that the system works; feel free to delete them.
